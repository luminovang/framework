**The Framework You Didn't Know You Needed to Illuminate Your Project**

PHP Luminova is a web development framework for PHP 8 and above. It's simple yet powerful, supporting both MVC and HMVC architectures. Luminova comes packed with useful modules for application security and optimization. Whether you prefer routing using PHP attributes or traditional code-based routing, we've got you covered.

## Installation

composer install luminovang/framework
